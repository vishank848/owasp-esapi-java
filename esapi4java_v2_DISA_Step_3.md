## Step 3. Start using your new common security control library ##

  1. Add new baseline requirements for input validation
  1. Add new baseline requirements for output encoding
  1. Use your common security control library wrapper to make fixes to existing code
  1. Use your common security control library wrapper for new development going forward
  1. Check off AppSec STIG requirements
    * APP3080 Invalid URL or path references found
    * APP3510 Insufficient input validation
    * APP3520 No Trust boundary data validation
    * APP3540 Application is vulnerable to SQL Injection
    * APP3550 Application is vulnerable to integer overflows
    * APP3560 Application contains format string vulnerabilities
    * APP3570 Application vulnerable to Command Injection
    * APP3580 Application vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting
    * APP3590 Application is vulnerable to buffer overflows
    * APP3600 Vulnerable to canonical representation attacks
