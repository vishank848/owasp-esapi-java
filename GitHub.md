In order to make ESAPI more accessible to developers and more easily accommodate potential contributors, a snapshot of the ESAPI trunk from Google Code was taken on 2014/09/18 and converted to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

You may access it via https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy via git or your web browser.

At this point, we are still using Google Code for tracking ESAPI issues, although eventually the plan is to move the issues to JIRA and will also be made available via using https://github.com/ issue tracking.
